from os import listdir
import glob

 Below method will list all the files including python, txt etc.
fileList = listdir('data/')
print fileList

 glob can be used to fetch the file names with a regular expression
csvFileList = glob.glob('data/*.csv')
print csvFileList

for filePath in csvFileList:
    print filePath



 This will create a list of lists
with open('data/enrollments.csv','rb') as f:
    reader = unicodecsv.reader(f)
    enrollmentslist = list(reader)


 Below commented code can be used to load all the data at once
fileDictObjects = []
for file in csvFileList:
    with open(file,'rb') as f:
        reader = unicodecsv.DictReader(f)
        fileDictObjects.append(list(reader))

print fileDictObjects[0][0]
